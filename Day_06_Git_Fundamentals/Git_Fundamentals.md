## Why Git for working with ROS?

1. **What is Git? and why we required this for working with ROS?**

**Ans:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system, meaning while creating software you may able to records changes to your code over time, and you may able to recall a specific version later. For example, you have added a feature in your software and added it to the Git. The feature has some bugs, so using Git you can go back to your earlier changes and check, what went wrong. Git can be used for coordinating work among programmers. The main application is of course we can track changes in any set of files.

2. **What is the level of expertise in Git you require inorder to work with ROS?**

**Ans:** You only need basic expertise in Git. Your project has to keep in Git, so you have to learn how to create a repository in Git and how to push your code into it.
You may also want to clone some of the other packages which are created by other developers. So you should able to clone the repository and pull the changes whenever it required.
